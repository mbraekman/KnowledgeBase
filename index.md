# Knowledge base

The purpose of this repo is to gather useful guidelines or documentation I've come across during projects. 

Why store this on GitHub, you ask?  
Well, why not?! This allows me to quickly acces this information, which could also be usefull for others.

What this repo will (*currently*) not contain is actual code (*C#, PowerShell, ARM-templates,...*). There might a snippet somewhere encapsulated into the documentation, but nothing more than that.   
If such a file is available, I will add a link towards the file in the corresponding repo.

*See anything that's wrong, feel to free to log an issue or create a PR!*
